# Dropdown Component Challenge
This exercise is mainly about styling, semantic/accessible JSX, and React basics. Your task is to create the design in the design1.png file in App.js

1. Must create and use a reusable dropdown component using React functional components and hooks where necessary.
2. Use the options `groupOptions` for the first dropdown, and `singerOptions` for the second dropdown. Note: as shown in the design, the first item in the second must read "-Select an option-" and cannot be selectable.
3. Match the styling and placement of the design. Font is Roboto.
